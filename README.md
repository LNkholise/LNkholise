One of the biggest problems in agriculture and farming comes with dealing with pests & parasites effectively. Knowing the identity of problem pests is critical to sourcing an effective means of managing such pests & parasites.
This project focuses on identifying,predicting & successfully partitioning available subspecies of collected insects using the k-means clustering method. 
By zooming in on respective, predicted species (clusters), it does a further analysis (logistic regression) on the sample data and classifies these insects within a certain species as either male or female, in the process showing mating preference variation between said species of water striders or any other similar insects of interest, either being pests, parasites and or otherwise.
All of this it accomplishes using dimensions (average leg length and body size) of said insects.
